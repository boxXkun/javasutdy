Running in the dark

MONKEY MAJIK

There's no time for what was left behind
It's a maiden voyage after all
All the pretty sinners
All the medal winners
Overachievers aiming for their prize
I can feel it coming
Don't know why you're running in the dark
She said
I'm looking everywhere but I can't find you
I'm getting closer like it's right in front of me
Yeah, I can feel you but I cannot see you
I'm reaching out
Reaching out
I could be dreaming but I feel so wide awake
A secret yearning that is deep inside of me
Yeah, I can feel you but I cannot see you
I'm reaching out
Reaching out
Ooh ooh ooh ah
Ooh ooh ooh ah
Yeah, I'm moving forward to my own beat once again
I can feel it calling after me
All the pretty sinners
All the medal winners
Overachievers aiming for their prize
I can feel it coming
Don't know why you're running in the dark
She said
I'm looking everywhere but I can't find you
I'm getting closer like it's right in front of me
Yeah, I can feel you but I cannot see you
I'm reaching out
Reaching out
I could be dreaming but I feel so wide awake
A secret yearning that is deep inside of me
Yeah, I can feel you but I cannot see you
I'm reaching out
Reaching out
You used to tell me that you wanted us to run away
Didn't matter, no, 'cause we'd be ok
Even now that we are miles apart, so far away
You're a part of me
Yeah, you light my way
I'm looking everywhere but I can't find you
I'm getting closer like it's right in front of me
Yeah, I can feel you but I cannot see you
I'm reaching out
Reaching out
I could be dreaming but I feel so wide awake
A secret yearning that is deep inside of me
Yeah, I can feel you but I cannot see you
I'm reaching out
Reaching out
Ooh ooh ooh ah
Ooh ooh ooh ah
